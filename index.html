    <h1>
        <pre>  Backtracking</pre>
    </h1>
    <pre>
    Backtracking iS a form of recursion. 
    
    The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your 
    choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is 
    repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, you final state is a goal state; if 
    you didn't, it isn't. 
    
    Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that 
    the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beggining with the root, you choose one of its 
    children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. 
    
    Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, 
    and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try 
    another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found. 
    
    This needs an example.</pre>

    <ol style="font-family: monospace;">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <pre style="background-color: #858585; padding:5px; width: 900px; border:5px; border-radius:5px; margin:25px;">    In this example we draw a picture of a tree. The tree is abstract model of the pssible sequences of choices we could 
    make. There iS also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we 
    have. (If we do have an actual tree data strucure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</pre>

    <h2><pre>  The Backtracking Algorithm.</pre></h2>
    <pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }else{
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
             return false
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <pre style="background-color: #858585; padding:5px; width: 900px; border:5px; border-radius:5px; margin:25px;">    Notice that the algorithmn is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorittvn. If 
    solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to 
    some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</pre>
    <h3 style=" font-family:monospace; margin:21px;">How does this work?</h3>
    <ul style=" font-family:monospace;">
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <pre>    Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any 
    child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines</pre>
    <pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
        for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
    </pre>
    <pre>    Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal
    node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</pre>
    <pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
        if n is a leaf node {
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
    </pre>
    <pre>   The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of starting it is as follows:</pre>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
        <li><h3>To search a Tree:</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <pre>    1. If the tree consists of a single leaf, test wheather it is a goal node.
    2. Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have
       searched them all unsuccessfully.
    </pre>
    <h2><pre>  Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</pre></h2>
    <pre>    Backtrackingis a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,
    that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</pre>
    <pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            put node n on the stack;
                while the stack is not empty {
                    if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                        if it is a goal node, return true
                            else pop it off the stack
                    }
                    else {
                        if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                            push the next untried child onto the stack
                        else pop the node off the stack
                }
            return false
        }
    </pre>
    <pre>    Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node curentty top of the 
    stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the 
    tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
    if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
    problem.

    When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal
    node.

    Similarly, when the recursive algoritrm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of 
    recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node 
    at the current level, or storing it in an array.

    Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
        if n is a leaf node {
            if the leaf is a goal node {
                print n
                return true
            }
                else return false
        } else {
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds {
                    print n
                    return true
                }
            }
            return false
        }
    }
</pre>
<h2><pre>  Keeping backtracking simple</pre></h2>
    <pre>    All of these versions of tre backtracking algotithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty 
    cluttered up with details. Even determining wheather the node is a leaf can be cornplex:

    for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate
    solutions.

    To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test 
    whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b style="font-family: calibri;">gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b style="font-family: calibri;">isLeaf</b>). This method would encapsulate all the 
    ugly details of figuring out wheather any possible moves remain.

    Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have 
    been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b style="font-family: calibri;">for each child 
        c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through 
    them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can 
    represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track 
    of which ones you've already examined?

    The most straightforward way to keep track of which chidren of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the 
    node (that is, when you first get there frotn above), make a list Of all its children. As you try each child, take it Off the list. When 
    the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "faliure." This is a simple approach, but it may require 
    quite a lot Of additional work.

    There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an
    ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.

    For example, you might be able to number the <b style="font-family: calibri;">children 1 through n,</b> and try then in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried 
    <b style="font-family: calibri;">child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b style="font-family: calibri;">k-1,</b> and you have rot yet tried children <b style="font-family: calibri;">k+1</b> through <b style="font-family: calibri;">n</b>. Or, if you 
    trying to color a map with just fOur colors, you can always try <b style="font-family: calibri;">red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails, 
    you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b style="font-family: calibri;">(or perhaps
        north, east, south, west).</b>
    
    It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b style="font-family: calibri;">In the chess game example,</b> you might number your 
    pieces (or perhaps the squares of the boad) try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several 
    moves, and these must also be ordered.</pre>

<h2><pre>  Example: Tree Search</pre></h2>
    <pre>    For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the 
    simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.

    A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point 
    to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. 
    All nodes reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not 
    part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The 
    first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.

    Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    public class BinaryTree {
        BinaryTree leftChild = null;
        BinaryTree rightChild = null;
        boolean isGoalNode = false;
        String name;

    BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
        this.name = name;
        leftChild = left;
        rightChild = right;
        this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
      }
    }
</pre>
<pre>    Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and init we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    static BinaryTree makeTree() {
        BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
        c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null,false);
        d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null,false);
        e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null,false);
        f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null,false);
        a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
        b = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b,false);
        return root;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
        System.out.println(solvable(tree));
    }
</pre>
<pre>    And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
    /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;
    /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
    /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    /* 5 */ return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</pre>
<ol style="font-family: monospace;">
    <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without 
        first checking wheather those children actually exist.</li>
    <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
    <li>See if the left of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null 
        and is not a goal node, says to</li>
    <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
    <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is rot solvable.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<pre>    This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</pre>
<br>
<pre>    Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An 
    alternative would be to cteck first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</pre>
    <br>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
        if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
        if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;        
        if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
        return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</pre>
<hr style="color: #858585; height: 2px; margin:35px;">
<h2><pre>   What are the children?</pre></h2>
<pre>    One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous 
    choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the 
    right chid are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without
    recursion.

    Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It iS a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter 
    how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the
    same color.

    To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are
    colored.

    There are two ways to do this:
</pre>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; margin: 7px;">
    <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
    <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of 
        countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<pre>    Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. Ttis should be easiy solvable; after all, a 
    checkerboard only needs two colors.</pre>
<br>
<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>boolean mapisOK()</b></pre>
<pre>    Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</pre>
<br>
<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b></pre>
<pre>    Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</pre>
<br>
<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b></pre>
<pre>    Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and the column of the next square on the checkerbord).</pre>
<br>
<pre>    Here's the code for method 1:</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
        if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapisOK();
        map[row][column] = color;
        for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
            int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
            if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    And here's the code for method 2:</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
        if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;
        if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
            map[row][column] = color;
            for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</pre>
<center>
<table border="2px solid black;" style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td style="background-color: #858585;">2 by 3 map</td>
        <td style="background-color: #858585;">3 by 3 map</td>
        <td style="background-color: #858585;">3 by 4 map</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #858585;">Method 1:</td>
        <td>60 ms.</td>
        <td>940 ms.</td>
        <td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #858585;">Method 2:</td>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>
<pre>    The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 milisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of 
    these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will 
    often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically 
    guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of ctoices), do so!</pre>

<h2><pre>   Debugging techniques</pre></h2>
<pre>    Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall 
    back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be 
    applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</pre>
<br>
<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entires and exits.</b></pre>
<pre>    Often, the best debuggihg technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably 
    want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long 
    list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</pre>
<br>
<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b></pre>
<pre>    Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, rernember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself 
    contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.

    Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs

<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statement.</b></pre>
<pre>    Writing debugging statementsis programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
    the actual program. ce your program is working, why throw this code away?

    Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging informationfrom a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to
    your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more in the above example'
    you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all These
    changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.

    The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    static final boolean debugging = false;

    static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
            System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
            indent = indent + "| ";
        }
    }

    static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
            indent = indent.substring(3);
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") reurn true");
        }
        return true;
    }

    static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
            indent = indent.substring(3);
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") reurn false");
        }
        return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about
    making your code larger; mordern compliers will notice that since the variable debuggingis fianl, it can never be true, and the
    controlled code will be discarded.

<pre style="font-family: calibri;">        <b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></pre>
<pre>    If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message 
    printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any otter, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. 
    However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
    code</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
</pre>
<pre>    will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. that is, the above code just acts like a
    print statement.</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">

<pre>    The backtracking method is named solvable retuns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, 
    wtich in this case means a positbn from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.

    Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recusive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
    puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to 
    print out the bad news.

    The backtracking method is named solvable retuns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, 
    wtich in this case means a positbn from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.

    Each possible move will resut in a new board postion, and these new board positions are the children of the current board 
    position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. 
    Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an orderng on these possible moves.

    Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of 
    approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find 
    a different but equally valid approach.

    First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, 
    it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and 
    check each marble in turn. When we have looked at the marbles, we have looked at the possible moves. This would require 
    having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the 
    board each time to find the marble we want. Neuther alternative is very attractive.

    Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a
    particular marble, we can talk about moving the moving the marble in a particular space. If move is possiblefrom a given space, then that 
    must be the only move possiblefrom that space, because the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. there is a slight 
    complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.

    <b style="font-family: calibri;">Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each 
        space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int
        position) which determines whether a move is possiblefrom the given position:</b>

</pre>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; margin: 7px;">
    <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
    <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to right;</li>
    <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to leftt;</li>
</ul>
<pre>    We write another method <b style="font-family: calibri;">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from
    taht position, and retur as its value anew board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,
    rather than creating a new one, but her we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"
    rather than "mutative."

    Along with <b style="font-family: calibri;">canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b style="font-family: calibri;">puzzlesolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that
    should be obvious.</pre>
<pre style="border: 2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; width:900px; color:#007EB4; border-color:#858585; margin:25px; padding:5px;">
    boolean solvable(int[] board) {
        if (puzzlesolved(board)) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
            if (canMove(board, position)) {
                int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);
                if (solvable(newBoard)) {
                    printBoard(newBoard);
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
</pre>
<pre>    Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzlesolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.

    Here is some output from the program:
</pre>
<div style="font-size: 18px; margin:30px; line-height:0px;">
<pre><i style="color:#6135fd">16.</i><b> WHITE WHITE WHITE ______ BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></pre>

</div>
<pre style="background-color: #D8D8D8; padding:5px; width: 950px; border:5px; border-radius:5px; margin:55px;">
    Notice that the solution is given in the reverse order; BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last
    line. I've added line numbers ti the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its 
    results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get
    them in the correct order.
